# Overfitting and Underfitting

## Machine Learning / Deep Learning

- Build machine-learning systems in order to help extract meaning from data 
by using a set of examples, try to learn general rules from the examples. When
the machine-learning systems have learned those rules enough, they can be applied
with new data. Though applying their learned rules to the new data, the systems can give
back useful information about that data. For example: given a set about dog images,
and cat images, how to build a model for predicting either a cat or a dog by 
giving an image about either a cat or a dog.

## Signs of Overfitting and Underfitting

- Overfitting: 

> In theory: when the model learns from the training data too well, and does poorly 
when presented with new data.

> In practice: during training time, when training loss tends to be low, and validation loss tends to be high, therefore it might be overfitting
